## List of important to monitoring things in your nodejs-application

 - CPU and memory usage: These metrics provide insight into the resource utilization of your application and can help identify performance bottlenecks  
 - Response time: This metric measures the time it takes for the application to respond
to a request and can help identify slow performance and potential scalability issues  
 - Error rates: Monitoring error rates can help you detect problems with your application, such as exceptions or unhandled errors  
 - Network traffic: Monitoring network traffic can help you understand the amount of data being sent and received by your application,
which can impact performance and scalability  
 - Database performance: If your application relies on a database, monitoring its performance is crucial.
This includes metrics such as query response time, number of connections, and available disk space  
 - Load balancing: If you have multiple instances of your application running behind a load balancer,
monitoring the distribution of traffic and resource utilization can help ensure that your application remains highly available  
 - Garbage collection: Monitoring garbage collection can help you understand how much memory is being allocated and freed, which can impact performance  
 - Event loop lag: This metric measures the time it takes for the event loop to process new requests, and can indicate potential performance
issues with the application  
 - Third-party APIs: If your application integrates with third-party APIs, monitoring their performance and availability is important
